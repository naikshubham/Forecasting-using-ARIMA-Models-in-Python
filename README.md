### Trend
A positive trend generally slopes up, the values increase with time.Similarly negative trend is when the values decrease.

### Seasonality
A seasonal time series has patterns that repeat at regular intervals. eg. High sales every weekend.

### Cyclicality
In contrast, cyclicality has repeating patterns but no fix period.

### White Noise
White Noise is an important concept in time series and ARIMA models. White Noise is a series of values where each value is **uncorrelated** with the previous value.
e.g Flipping a coin : The outcome of coin flipping does'nt depend on outcome of coin flipping that came before.
