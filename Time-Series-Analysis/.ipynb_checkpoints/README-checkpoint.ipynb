    "### Some useful Pandas Tools\n",
    "- Changing an index to datetime\n",
    "`df.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plotting data\n",
    "`df.plot()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Join two DataFrames\n",
    "`df1.join(df2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often, we will want to convert prices to returns, which we can do with the `pct_change` method. Or if we want differences we can use the `diff` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['col'].pct_change()\n",
    "df['col'].diff()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can compute the correlation of two series using the `corr` method and the autocorrelation using the `autocorr` method.\n",
    "`df['ABC'].corr(df['XYZ'])`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation of Two Time Series\n",
    "- A scatter plot helps to visualize the relationship between two time series. The **correlation coefficient** is the measure of how much two series vary together.\n",
    "- A correlation of 1 means that the two series have a perfect linear relationship with no deviations. High correlations means that the two series strongly vary together. A low correlation means that they vary together but there is a weak association.\n",
    "- And a high negative correlation means they vary in opposite directions, but still with a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common mistake : Correlation of Two trending Series\n",
    "- Consider two time series that are both trending. Even if the two series are totally unrelated, we could still get a very high correlation. That's why, when we look at the correlation of two stocks, we should look at the correlation of their **returns** not their levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example : Correlation of Large Cap and Small Cap stocks\n",
    "- Computing the correlation of two financial time series, the S&P500 index of large cap stocks and the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks, using pandas correlation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First compute the percentage changes of both series. This gives the **returns of the series instead of prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['SPX_Ret'] = df['SPX_Prices'].pct_change()\n",
    "df['R2000_Ret'] = df['R2000_Prices'].pct_changes()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visualize the correlation using the scatter plot\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.scatter(df['SPX_Ret'], df['R2000_Ret'])\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use pandas correlation method for series\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "correlation = df['SPX_Ret'].corr(df['R2000_Ret'])\n",
    "print('Correlation is :\", correlation)\n",
