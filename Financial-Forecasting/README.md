## Financial forecasting

### Financial statements
- Records that outline the financial activities of a business, an individual or any other entity and provide an excellent format for reading and comparison

#### Types of financial statements
1. **Income statements** , also known as a profit and loss statement, which is a statement of the income and expenses of a company.
2.  **Balance sheet** : A statement of assests, liabilities and capital of a business.
3. Cash Flow statement
4. Statement of shareholder's equity

#### How are financial statements used in forecasting ?
- Financial statements provide important metrics of the financial health of a company, now and in the future.
- We will use the metrics of the income statement and balance sheet as our structure for financial forecasting.

#### Income statement / profit & loss statement
- Income statement is split into two profit totals.The two are gross profit and net profit.
- Gross profit : **Direct sales and costs**
- Net profit : **Indirect income and expenses**

#### Gross profit
- Only costs and income related to the sale of a company's goods or services can be placed here. In finance terms, this is called **cost of goods sold** , which is often abberviated to **COGS**
- Gross profit is a useful indicator of how profitable a product is on its own merit, and is an important indicator of the underlying product.

```python
cogs = material_costs + direct_labor_costs + factory_costs
gross_profit = sales - cogs
```

#### Net profit
- Almost everything else, other than costs and income from directly manufacturing or producing the product or service of the company, will be put here.
- The calculation for **net profit** is gross profit minus operating expenses or **OpEx**

```python
opex = insurance + admin_sales + r_d + training_cost + other_non_direct_costs

net_profit = gross_profit - opex
```
